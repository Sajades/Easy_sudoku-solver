# Neural-networks
This project explores the design, implementation, and performance analysis of deep neural networks across a variety of problems It aims to understand how different architectures, activation functions, optimization techniques, and regularization methods impact model effectiveness.

In this project I used flattened sudoku grid and created 81 features. Then randomly removed 1 value for each puzzle and put them in target column 'y'.
The goal is to trian the model to find the correct answer of the missing value.
